# Recipe

## Ingredients

- 32 oz chicken stock (made using a store bought rotisserie chicken - meat separated for use in soup)
- 16 oz of crushed tomatoes
- 4 oz of heavy cream (used a quarter of pint aprox - go slow in this step - looking for an orange-y red colour)
- 2 oz of pre-cooked Orzo (you may not want to add it all to your soup, you decide at the moment)
- 1/2 the meat from the chicken, pulled into small pieces (similar size as the orzo)
- 4 regular carrots
- 4 stalks of celery
- 1/2 regular onion (chopped small, same size as the orzo)
- Sugar to taste
- Salt to taste
- Basil to taste
- Paprika to taste
- White Pepper to taste
- Cayenne Pepper to taste
- Butter to finish

## Steps

1. In a large pot, add some oil on medium heat.
1. Add onions, carrots and celery, salt and sweat them, 8-10 minutes.
1. Add stock, tomatoes, cream, sugar, basil, paprika, white pepper and cayenne papper and bring to a simmer, 5 - 10 minutes.
1. Season with sugar to taste. May not need it depending on what kind of tomatoes are being used.
1. Add orzo and chicken, until orzo is finished cooking.
1. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Off the heat, add a knob of butter and stir it in until it melts.

## Notes

- There are no measurements for the herbs/spices because someone was trying to recreate the dish. Considering this is based on 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of crushed tomatoes, I would probably aim for a full 1 tbsp on the basil and paprika and maybe a tsp of the cayenne pepper. Crushed tomatoes can be decently acidic so I would add enough sugar to leave some of the acidity for some complexity but not enough for it to be overly sweet.
- I would probably use some tomato paste here and cook it out with the vegetables for some extra complexity.
- Bonus: Serve with roasted garlic butter spread on warm crusty bread. Roast a head of garlic for about 1/2 hour at 350F. Combine with equal amount of butter in immersion blender and add a bit of chicken stock to taste.
- Important orzo information - Orzo in soup: https://www.cooksinfo.com/orzo - "When using in soups, bear in mind that it will swell up to about 4 times its size. As a rough guide, try no more than around 50g (Â¼ cup) of dry orzo per 2 litres (2 quarts / 8 cups of soup) being made"
- The stock is listed as these ingredients if you want to make it yourself: Chicken Stock (Water, Chicken Bones, Carrots, Celery, Onions, Garlic Black Peppercorns, Bay Leaf).
- I made up the steps because no steps were given.
