# Chana Masala

### @TODO: I have to go through this recipe again. The steps are fine but I want to rewrite them a bit.

## Ingredients

- 250g chickpeas
- 1l water
- 1 teabag
- 3 tbsp ghee or vegetable oil
- 4 medium onions, diced
- 2 tsp garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp ginger, diced
- 3 green chilis, julienned
- 5 tomatoes, concasse or puree

## Steps

### Chickpeas (if making)

1. Combine chickpeas, teabag, 1 tsp salt and water in a pot.
1. Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and cover for 2 hours.

### Chana

1. In a pan over medium heat, add 3 tbsp vegetable oil and your 4 medium diced onions until translucent.
1. Add garlic, ginger and chilis until fragrant.
1. Add tomatoes, 2 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp cumin powder, 1/2 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp red paprika, 2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves.
1. Bring to a simmer and let it cook for 20 minutes.

### Toast Spices

1. In a pan over low - medium heat, add 1/4 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp crushed and toasted cumin seeds, 1 tsp crushed and toasted coriander seeds, and 1 tbsp ginger.

### Combine

1. Combine toasted spices with chana and remove from the heat.
1. Add lemon juice.

This is the final flavouring and you'll prep it as things are simmering. In a new pan, put the cumin and coriander seeds over low heat and squash them with your wok spatula or the bottom of a glass. Whatever you like. Go ahead and add them and the spices into the chana and turn the heat off. This includes the coriander leaves you reserved. These instructions on the web are a nightmare. I hope his book is better. The final step is to add the lemon juice and mix it in. When you serve them, people can have the julienne ginger if they like.

One of the things it says to do is skim off any excess oil, but I sort of like it. You may not even have any. I didn't. This keeps really well and you can freeze it and easily reheat it. I love it with naan or roti.

I hope I sorted it all out. Even if nobody cares, I at least have this all down for my wife who was utterly confused by the recipe directions. Now that you (and hopefully she) understand the how/why of the process, this will be easy to make. It's really about 30-45 minutes of prep aside from the soaking and about 2h30m total to make with maybe 30m of effort in the cooking. What I like is his ratio of spices. This really was amazingly balanced. The color due to the tea, paprika and tumeric was beautiful as well. The fresh coriander on top at the end was a nice touch.

## Notes

- The lemon made it too acidic. I would not do this unless it really isn't acidic enough. It could be because I used tomato puree instead of tomatoes.
- Be careful about how much garam masala you're using at the end. I used way too much. It was still very good, but almost too spice-forward (not hot spicy).
