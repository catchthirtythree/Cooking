## Notes

- We used eggplant, onion, green beans, carrots and brocolli and it was great. Probably could have doubled the curry paste and coconut amounts though.
- This recipe is looking for a large can of coconut milk, not the small Thai Kitchen ones.
- We did not use lemongrass, it's probably already in the paste anyway.
- We served it with air-fried tofu.
    - Cut tofu into 2-inch chunks, add seasonings and a tiny bit of oil, pop into air-fryer at 400 for about 15 - 20 minutes.
