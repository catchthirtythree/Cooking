# Stir Fry Template

## Ingredients

### Rice

- 1 cup rice (2/3 long grain, 1/3 jasmine)

### Fry

- 1 stalk celery
- 1 bell pepper
- 1 shallot
- 1 spring onion
- 1 cup chicken breast, sliced
- 1 cup bean sprouts
- 1 egg

### Sauce

- 2 tbsp white sugar
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce or hoisin sauce (if using hoisin, use half the amount)
- 1 tsp vinegar
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 tsp corn starch (for thickening, for a glossy finish)

## Steps

### Cook the rice

- Cook the rice according to the instructions with a big pinch of salt or tsp of chicken bouillon.
- To properly dry to rice, spread on a cookie sheet and leave in the fridge overnight.
- To lazily dry the rice, pop the rice into any container and leave in the fridge overnight.
- Set aside a cup of the rice.

### Make the sauce

- Mix all of your ingredients together in a bowl and stir well.
- Add corn starch if you want a thicker and glossier sauce, although not necessary.
- Set aside.

### Protein

- Cut the chicken breast into small, cube-like pieces and season with salt and pepper.
- Set chicken aside in a bowl.

### Vegetables

- Cut all of your vegetables into long strips or on a bias to get longer pieces.
- Set vegetables aside in a bowl.

### Stir fry

- Set a large pan on your stove top at high heat.
- Add a neutral oil and wait until shimmering / smoking.
- Add your protein and cook until opaque, about a minute, moving constantly.
- Add your veggies and cook until slightly softened, about a minute, moving constantly.
- Add your rice and toss with the protein and veggies until mixed well.
- Add your sauce around the edges of the pan and toss until mixed well.
- Move all contents of the pan to the side and add the egg.
- Once the whites of the egg have set, crack the yolk and start tossing the stir fry over it.
- Add a tsp of pure sesame oil and continue tossing.
- Once everything is mixed well and to your liking, serve.

## Notes

- I've called this Stir Fry Template because this is the template I'm using for making stir fries. You can add pretty much protein, carb, vegetable, etc... that you want, you just need to make sure it's cooked how it's meant to be cooked. The sauce should be pretty easy to change, but if you want a chinese style fried rice flavour, this is the way to go.
- The rice mix is tasty, but not absolutely necessary. Any long grain rice should do here. The reason for the rice mix is that jasmine rice has a nutty flavour but very delicate texture whereas a white long grain rice will be a better, more toothsome texture but not as much flavour.

## Techniques

- Keep stirring all the way through. You don't want to cook anything too much. Vegetables should be crunchy.
