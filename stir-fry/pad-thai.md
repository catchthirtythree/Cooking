# Pad Thai

## Ingredients

- 4oz pad thai noodles
- 1/4 lbs chicken breast or thigh
- 1 cup bean sprouts
- 2 springs onions
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp distilled white vinegar
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsps toasted peanuts
- 1 lime
- 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes

## Steps

### Prepare the noodles

- Add the noodles to a bowl of warm water for 30 minutes.

### Mise en place

- Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces.
- Cut the spring onions into 1 inch segments or julienne cut.
- Mix the sugar, vinegar and fish sauce.
- If the peanuts aren't toasted, toast them.

### Stir-fry

- Get a pan very hot.
- Add 3 tbsp vegetable oil to the pan and wait until it starts shimmering.
- Add the chicken to the pan and until it becomes opaque but not fully cooked.
- Add the noodles and sauce to the pan, constantly stirring, until the noodles absorb the sauce.
- Push the noodles and chicken to the side and add the egg, breaking it up once the whites set.
- Mix the egg with the noodles.
- Remove the chicken, noodles and egg from the pan.
- Add the bean sprouts and spring onions to the pan and toss.
- Transfer everything to a place and serve with peanuts, lime and red pepper flakes.

## Notes

- I've used a cast-iron skillet for this. It's very messy, but it works.
- You can add 1 tbsp of soy sauce to the sauce.
- You can sub the fish sauce for soy sauce but be careful of burning it when you mix it into the stir-fry. I've really liked it when done this way. I might try mixing both next time.
- You can sub out chicken for medium tofu. You will have to spend some time actually shallow frying the tofu before continuing onto the next steps though.

## Techniques

- I've been watching some pad thai / stir-fry videos and it seems like the best way to go about doing this is to actually do your protein first and remove from the pan (unless using tofu, keep tofu in the pan), add your veggies, add your noodles and sauce, move everything to the side and add your egg(s), stir everything together very well, add your protein and garnishes and mix well, then serve.
