1. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant and light golden, about 2 minutes.
1. Pour in broth.
1. Add chicken, beans, cream cheese, green chiles, gochujang, oregano, cumin, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and a few grinds of pepper.
1. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer until chicken is tender and just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.
1. Transfer chicken to a plate and shred with 2 forks.
1. Smash about one-quarter of beans in chili with the back of a spoon.
1. Return shredded chicken to pot and add corn.
1. Bring to a simmer and cook until chicken and corn are warmed through, 4 to 6 minutes.

1. Ladle chili into bowls. Top with tortilla chips, sour cream, cheddar, kimchi, scallions, sesame seeds, and more cilantro.

## Notes

- We used a mixture of different types of beans and it was tasty, although I'd probably go for the cannellini or red kidney beans next time.
