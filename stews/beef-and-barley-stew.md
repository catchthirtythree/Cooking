## Notes

- I did this the laziest way possible and it turned out great. Start with oil, do salted mirepoix + garlic, push over and do salted mushrooms, push over and do salted beef, add a knob of butter and 2 tbsp flour and stir out, add broth and bay leaves and tomato paste, add barley, serve. I fixed the steps a little to be a little better.
