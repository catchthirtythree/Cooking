# Beef Ragu

## Ingredients

- 250g Ground Beef
- 120g Baby Greens (Spinach or Kale)
- 1 Garlic Clove, minced
- 100g Soffritto
- 400ml Canned Tomatoes
- 1/4 Cup Water
- 10g Dry/Powdered Spices
    - Garlic Powder
    - Onion Powder
    - Basil
    - Parsely
    - Oregano
    - Thyme
    - Cayenne Pepper
    - Black Pepper
    - Sage
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil

## Steps

1. Get a drizzle of olive oil hot in a pan on medium-high heat.
1. Add the beef, season it with 1/3 of the spices and and salt, breaking it up and cooking until browned, 7-10 minutes.
1. Add the soffritto and the garlic to the pan, season with salt and pepper and let it sweat until softened and fragrant, 3-5 minutes.
1. Add the tomatoes, water, the rest of the spices.
1. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat until it's simmering, then leave it, stirring sometimes, to thicken.
1. Add the greens and stir in until wilted.

## Notes

- A soffritto consists small-cubed onion, celery and carrot at a ratio of 2:1:1.
- If you're adding pasta to this, stir them in towards the end with the greens and add the pasta water as needed. The mixture will need to be a little loose so the pasta can absorb some of liquid and cook further if needed.
