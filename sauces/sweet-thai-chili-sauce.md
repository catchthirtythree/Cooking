# Notes

- How spicy this is depends on how spicy the chillis are. I've used 50g of the spiciest thai chillis and 100g of the weakest thai chillis and the spice level comes out different each time. I suggest deseeding and depithing the chillis even if it takes a while.
- I have not tried this with other hot peppers. It would be an interesting experiment to see what flavours you can extract from them. You may have to adjust for heat.
- The thai kitchen thai chili sauce is not garlicky. I would go in with either 1-2 cloves or not to recreate.
- I tried a version with the chilis we are growing in our garden, no garlic and maybe 1/4 - 3/8 cups sugar and it turned out really good. I would make this version again. It went really well with steak.
- I would recommend starting with 1/8 - 1/4 cup sugar and only adding more after you've reduced the mixture and added the slurry and it's at a consistency you like. It's very easy to add too much sugar to this sauce.
- I tried this with habaneros and it was very good. Do not handle habaneros without gloves. The first day or two, it will be very spicy.
