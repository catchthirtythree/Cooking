# Recipe

## Ingredients

### Sauce

- 25-50g thai chillis
- 3-5 cloves of garlic
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 3/4 cup water
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1 tsp salt

### Slurry

- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 tbsp water

## Steps

### Mise en place

- Deseed and depith the chillis as much as possible.
- Add the garli and chillis to a blender and blend until smooth.
- Mix the slurry ingredients and mix them together until smooth.

### Make the sauce

- Add the sauce ingredients to a small pot.
- Bring the mixture to a slow boil and simmer for 5 minutes.
- Mix the slurry and add to the pot.
- Simmer for another 5 minutes until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.
- Remove from the heat and let cool.

# Notes

- How spicy this is depends on how spicy the chillis are. I've used 50g of the spiciest thai chillis and 100g of the weakest thai chillis and the spice level comes out different each time. I suggest deseeding and depithing the chillis even if it takes a while.
- I have not tried this with other hot peppers. It would be an interesting experiment to see what flavours you can extract from them. You may have to adjust for heat.
