# Notes

- How spicy this is depends on how spicy the chillis are. I've used 50g of the spiciest thai chillis and 100g of the weakest thai chillis and the spice level comes out different each time. I suggest deseeding and depithing the chillis even if it takes a while.
- The Thai Kitchen thai chili sauce is not garlicky. If you're trying to recreate it, I would halve the garlic or remove it entirely.
- I tried a version with the chilis we are growing in our garden, no garlic and maybe 1/4 - 3/8 cups sugar and it turned out really good. I would make this version again. It went really well with steak.
- I tried this with habaneros and it was very good. Do not handle habaneros without gloves. I used only 30g habaneros each time.
- If you want a smokey taste, consider grilling your peppers before blending them.
