- In a medium-size bowl, add greek yogurt, cucumbers, parsley, garlic, and olive oil; mix and season with salt and pepper to taste.

## Notes

- Some optional ingredients included here because while the main ingredients will get you what you're looking for, the optional ingredients will make it taste much better, however dill and mint aren't to everyone's taste.

## Techniques

- Squeezing and draining the excess water from the cucumbers is very important to not get a thin sauce.
