# Tzatziki

## Ingredients

- 2 medium cucumbers
- 1 (16 ounce) container plain Greek yogurt
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 1/2 medium lemon, juiced
- Salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Steps

1. Peel cucumbers; remove seeds with a spoon. Grate cucumber on the large holes of a box grater, then squeeze to drain excess liquid.
1. In a mixing bowl combine the cucumber with Greek yogurt, garlic, olive oil, dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Stir until well combined.
1. Serve immediately or for best flavor cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.

## Notes

- To ensure extra-thick tzatziki, make sure your yogurt is thick to begin with. You can use any type of yogurt and strain it yourself in the fridge. Just set a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth over a bowl. Add yogurt, cover, and refrigerate until the liquid drains off, 8 hours to overnight.
- I used a full lemon's worth of lemon juice in mine and I loved it.
- It's fine to use garlic powder but be careful how much you use, it takes a while for its flavour to really come out and it's easy to over use it.
- You will need to use a lot of salt if you're serving this chilled. Cold things tend to need more salt.
- I used Chobani's 2% Greek Yogurt and it was good, it just needed a little bit of sugar, maybe a teaspoon.
- I used a large cucumber and it was more than enough.
- Some paprika works very nice in here.
