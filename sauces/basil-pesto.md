# Recipe

## Ingredients

- 2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan-Reggiano cheese
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup pine nuts
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Steps

- Combine the basil, garlic, and pine nuts in a food processor or blender and pulse until coarsely chopped.
- With the machine running, slowly add the olive oil and process until smooth.
- Add the cheese and pulse until combined.
- Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

## Notes

- This is how I should have done it when I tried, but I did it differently: I didn't stream the oil in (potential to make the oil bitter if overheated/overworked), I used italian + thai basil + mint + hot chilli leaves (quite bitter + taste of capsaicin, I had to tame these with sweetness) and I had to save it with some honey and lemon juice (which actually turned out very good, I recommend honey) and I used walnuts instead of pine nuts. I also halved the recipe. I will need to test it out more before coming up with a definitive recipe but I was happy with what I came out with in the end.
