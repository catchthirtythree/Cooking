turkey gravy with parts

- add carrots, onions, celery and cook until vegetables soften and brown
- add water/stock until everything is covered, thyme and bay leaves
- bring to a boil, then bare simmer for 45 minutes
- strain through a fine mesh strainer
- reserve stock until needed

- melt some butter and a bit more than equal parts flour and cook stirring constantly until flour is golden brown
- add about 4 cups of stock slowly

- season and cover to keep warm

(I used the turkey drippings from the tray + 3 tbps flour)
(I didn't realize there was some oily fat in the tray and it did not mix with the flour no matter what)
(I had to strain it out and put the goopy floury/fat back in the pot until it became golden)
(Then I added the stock in and had to season with salt)
