## People: 20

------------------------------------

How much turkey per person? 1 - 1.5lbs.

20 people * 1 - 1.5lb/person = 20 - 30 lbs

------------------------------------

How much turkey do we currently have?

Turkey = 5.492 kg = 12.107787 lbs

------------------------------------

## Food

### Seasoning

#### Rosemary Salt
- I want this on basically everything, I think rosemary and sage are good turkey day spices and this should be spread across everything.

### Charcuterie

#### Baked Brie
- I like this Chef John recipe except I would do it without the dough around it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkzz9dW9Yms
- Basically, halve a wheel of brie, press some cranberries into one half and press some walnuts into the other half, press the halves into each other, bake for 20 minutes at 425.

#### Baguette
- Using this recipe for the baguette: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FR__Gt0CSo
- You should be able to toss the dough in the fridge to proof at the "Shaping and proofing" stage.
- The dough will probably need to rest for about an hour to an hour and a half the next day before actually shaping and proofing.
- They can be baked off early in the morning, before we think about putting the turkey in.

#### Meats
- Soppressata, mortadella, any of the roma sausages.

#### Jam
 - Cranberry sauce can work very well here with the cheese.

### Mains

#### Wreath (x2)
- The night before:
 - Roast the veggies.
 - Mix with the halloumi.
 - Shape the wreath.
 - Cover and refrigerate.
- The veggies can be roasted spread out on the half trays at 350 in the oven (400 for colour). It should take less time than in a pot, probably only around 20 minutes.

#### Stuffing
- I like Brian Lagerstrom's recipe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8J2HgaaSgQ
- I would remove the raisins, otherwise I like that he uses boxed chicken stock.
- We might need two pyrex dishes for it?
- Otherwise, I have a recipe in the `2022/easter` plan. It's pretty basic and requires no eggs.

#### Mashed Potatoes
- I have a decent recipe in the `2022/easter` plan. I added too much sour cream for Kristin at thanksgiving so be very careful adding sour cream.
- I should be able to make these ahead of time and warm them up day of. In the microwave would be perfect.
- I like this recipe because it makes enough for 25 people, seems like I'll need about 8-10lbs of russet potatoes: https://www.fodmapeveryday.com/recipes/do-ahead-mashed-potatoes-for-a-crowd/
- This is another good recipe, probably the one I'll use: https://rouxbe.com/recipes/108-mashed-potatoes-for-a-crowd

#### Peas
- We probably need about 3-4 cans of peas.

#### Cranberry sauce
- There's a traditional cranberry sauce recipe at the bottom of this page that looks promising: http://www.mycleankitchen.com/cranberry-apple-chutney-traditional-cranberry-sauce/
- Orange is pretty common in cranberry sauce for sweetness, a citrus note and brightness.
- Apparently, a bag of cranberries is around 12oz = 340g.
- This could easily be made ahead of time and covered. We just need to let it come up to room temperature for the meal.

#### Turkey
- In total, we need about 10-12kg of turkey.
- The plan is to butcher both turkeys the day before.
- I'll use the necks, spines and wings to make stock, leaving me with two breasts and two whole legs.
- I'll need some containers for holding stock. I don't need too many because I will be using a good amount of it for the gravy the next day (and maybe even the stuffing if we want).
- I should have two half sheets with racks which would be good enough to cook all of the turkey.
- The plan is to dry brine with salt the day before and to rub with a simple herb butter the day of.

#### Turkey Stock + Gravy
- I need a good recipe for gravy for 20 people.
- I'm not sure how much of everything is needed here...

### Desserts
- We're not doing desserts. Other people will bring.

#### Baguette

##### Timing
- This can be prepared the day before, preferably at night.
- The baguette needs 30-60 minutes to come to room temperature before shaping and proofing. Take into consideration that from this point, the recipe still needs ~120 minutes before ending up with a finished product.
- Also keep in mind that this can be done relatively early and the baguettes will still be warm inside, maybe 2-3 hours before eating.

##### Ingredients
- 225g warm water
- 350g bread flour
- 10g salt
- 8g instant yeast
- 30g warm water

##### Steps

- In a large bowl, add flour and water and mix until fully combined. Add salt over dough and cover.
- After 15-20minutes, add yeasted water to the dough and mix with a wet hand until salt and yeast are fully incorporated.
- Cover and allow to sit for 30 minutes.
- Fold the dough and shape, cover and allow to sit for 30 minutes.
- Fold the dough and shape, cover and allow to sit for 90 minutes.
- Flour work surface lightly and place dough on the surface.
- Split the dough into two equal portions.
- Degas, fold and preshape both doughs into balls, cover and allow to sit for 15 minutes.
- Shape dough balls into baguettes and place onto oiled parchment paper.
- Cover and allow to proof for 60 minutes.
- Spray baguettes with water and score them.
- Cover and bake in a 450 oven for 15 minutes.

##### Ingredients
- 1 bag Fresh Cranberries
- 1 Orange
- 1/2 cup Honey
- 1 Cinnamon Stick
- 1/8 teaspoon Freshly Grated Nutmeg (about 12-15 passes on the microplane)

##### Steps

- Cut the orange in half and squeeze the juice from one half into the saucepan.
- Add the cinnamon stick and nutmeg.
- Add honey to the saucepan.
- Turn on heat to medium or medium high.

#### Mashed Potatoes

##### Timing
- This can be done the day before.
- It would be nice to get this into an oven-safe vessel so we can roast for like 20 minutes the day of.
- This is going to be a lot of potatoes.

##### Ingredients
- 8lbs russet potatoes
- 4 bay leaves
- 2 cups half and half, cream or whole milk
- 1/3 lb unsalted butter
- 1 tbsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp ground white pepper
- 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter

##### Steps
- Peel potatoes.
- Rince potatoes and cut them into 1 1/2 inch cubes.
- Place potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water.
- Add salt and bay leaves to potatoes and bring pot to a boil.
- Drain immediately once able to pierce the potatoes easily with a knife/fork.
- In a small pot, bring butter and cream to a gentle boil.
- Whisk in salt, pepper and nutmeg, and set aside.
- Add the cream to the potatoes little by little and mash them until they're the right consistency.
- Add salt and pepper to taste.
- Place thin slices of butter over the top and cover with plastic wrap to avoid creating a crust.
- Cover and let sit until ready to serve.

##### Reference
- I have a decent recipe in the `2022/easter` plan. I added too much sour cream for Kristin at thanksgiving so be very careful adding sour cream.
- I should be able to make these ahead of time and warm them up day of. In the microwave would be perfect.
- https://rouxbe.com/recipes/108-mashed-potatoes-for-a-crowd

##### Notes
- bring pot of salted water up to a boil (alternatively, boil in chicken stock / bouillon for extra flavour)
- add sour cream for tang (maybe a tbps? go slow with this)
- add roasted garlic (roast halved garlic at 350 for an hour)
- add chives

#### Peas
- I think a bag or two of frozen peas would work here.
- Search 'seasoned peas', makes for 50 so scale down by 2/5ths: https://www.chef-menus.com/quantity_recipes_vegetables.html

#### Turkey
- In total, we need about 10-12kg of turkey.
- The plan is to butcher both turkeys the day before.
- I'll use the necks, spines and wings to make stock, leaving me with two breasts and two whole legs.
- I'll need some containers for holding stock. I don't need too many because I will be using a good amount of it for the gravy the next day (and maybe even the stuffing if we want).
- I should have two half sheets with racks which would be good enough to cook all of the turkey.
- The plan is to dry brine with salt the day before and to rub with a simple herb butter the day of.

#### Turkey Stock + Gravy

##### Timing
- The stock can be made a day or two before.
- The gravy can be done the day before or the day of. It's helpful to make the roux with turkey drippings but it's not entirely necessary.

- 1 large onion, thickly sliced
- 1 large carrot, thickly sliced

##### Steps

###### Stock

- Put the ingredients in a heavy pot and add enough water to cover.
- Bring to a boil over medium heat, skimming any foam that accumulates.
- Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 2 hours.
- Add more water as needed to keep ingredients covered. Skim off foam and excess fat.
- **OPTIONAL**: Drain stock into clean saucepan and reduce to 3½ cups.

###### Gravy
- To a large saucepan add the hot meat drippings or fat. Add the flour and blend well.
