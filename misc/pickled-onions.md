- Yucatan style pickled onions are really good too. Instead of vinegar you use grapefruit, Orange and lime juice, add some salt, peppercorns, Bay leaves and allspice.

- My fam is from Belize. 1/2 vinegar, 1/4 lime juice, 1/4 water. A pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar. Onions and habaneros (not chopped too fine if you donâ€™t want too much spice, you just want them to flavor the liquid) and a little cilantro. Peppercorns bay leaves and allspice berries. I add oregano and a cinnamon stick, not how I was taught but just because I like the flavor.

- Up your sandwich game. Red onion thin as possible, mince garlic into a paste, olive oil, white or rice vinegar, little snp, oregano. Put in tupperware, shake it to mix. Sandwich game elevated.

- I do about 2 parts vinegar to 1 part water, sometimes less water than that. Also usually 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to 1 teaspoon of salt, but that obviously depends on the size of your jar. Mine holds about 3 big onions if I pack them in. The Balkan grocery near me has this awesome lemony vinegar that is amazing for this. I very much recommend experimenting with different vinegars, or combos of them. I also like to throw in 1 fresh habanero per jar, 1-2 garlic cloves, and some fennel seeds. Other whole spices if I feel like it. They're not gonna go bad on you, but at some point the flavor mostly leeches out of the onions and into the vinegar again. You can see this the clearest with red onions, they'll get way paler after about 2 weeks while the liquid gets darker in color. The good news is that when you've finished the jar you can take out the aromatics and use your delicious onion-and-whatever-else-flavored vinegar for awesome salad dressings, or to drizzle on sandwiches, or whatever else you need vinegar for.

- I find it interesting that so many people seem to add sugar to it. I usually do 1:1 water and vinegar, and then salt to taste, and that's it. At least for red onions, they come out very sweet tasting still. Depends on the onion I guess.
