# Korean Pancake (Pajeon)

## Ingredients

- ½ pound well-fermented napa cabbage kimchi, chopped into small pieces, plus 2 tablespoons of the brine
- 3 scallions, chopped
- ½ teaspoon sugar
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup water
- 4 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Steps

- Combine the kimchi, kimchi brine, scallions, sugar, flour, and water in a medium bowl and mix well with a spoon.
- Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. (If you don’t have a 12-inch skillet, use a smaller skillet to make 2 pancakes.)
- Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.
- Pour the batter into the pan and spread it with the back of a spoon or a spatula to make a large circle.
- Cook until the bottom is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.
- Carefully turn the pancake over. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons oil around the edges of the skillet, then lift the pancake with a thin spatula to allow the oil to run underneath and tilt the pan to spread it evenly.
- Cook until the bottom of the pancake is light golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.
- Flip it one more time and cook for another minute.
- Slide onto a large serving platter and serve immediately.

## Notes

- I use kkakdugi for this and it's quite amazing.
- The plain browned scallions are more amazing than having the scallions in the kimchi in my opinion.
- Make dang sure to make both sizes crunchy. It's fantastic.
