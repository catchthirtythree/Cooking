# Daikon Kimchi (Kkakdugi)

## Ingredients

- 4 pounds Korean radish (or daikon)
- 2 tbs kosher salt
- 2 tbs sugar
- ¼ cup fish sauce
- ⅔ cup Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)
- 4 stalks of green onions, chopped
- 2 tbs minced garlic (about 5 or 6 cloves garlic)
- 1 ts minced ginger

## Steps

- Peel Korean radish, rinse in cold water and pat dry.
- Cut it into ¾ to 1 inch cubes. Put into a large bowl.
- Add kosher salt and sugar, and mix well.
- Set aside for 30 minutes.
- Drain the juice from the radish into a small bowl.
- Add minced garlic, minced ginger, green onions, fish sauce, hot pepper flakes, and ⅓ cup of the juice from the radish.
- Mix it up well until the seasonings coat the radish cubes evenly, and the radish looks juicy.
- Put the kkakdugi into a glass jar and press down on the top of it to remove any air from between the radish cubes.
- You can eat it right away, and then store it in the refrigerator. Or you can let it ferment by keeping it outside of the refrigerator for a few days. When it starts fermenting, little bubbles may appear on top of the kkakdugi and it’ll smell strong & sour. Then put it in the refrigerator.

## Notes

- Make sure to measure how much in ingredients you have. It's very easy to over salt this. If you do mistakenly over salt it, DO NOT USE THE BRINE. Use water instead because that brine will be very salty.
- If you like your kkakdugi sweeter, add 1 or more extra tbs of sugar.
- The amount of hot pepper flakes you use depends on your taste; use ¼ cup hot pepper flakes for a mild version. For a vegetarian version, replace fish sauce with soy sauce.
- It's totally okay to put spring onions and carrots and whatever else in this with the daikon, just be careful of the salt. If the original recipe calls for 2tbsp of salt for 4lbs of daikon, that means it's using around 1.6% salt by weight. If you change the amount of vegetables that you are turning into kimchi, measure it and calculate 1.6% of that weight to figure out the salt content that you need. The same could be said for sugar.

```
4lbs = 1814.37g
2tbsp = 28.3g

28.3 / 1814.37 ≈ 0.016 = 1.6%
```
