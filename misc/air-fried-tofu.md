# Air-fried Tofu

## Ingredients

- 500g Firm Tofu
- Whatever spices you want

## Steps

## Drying the tofu

- Remove the tofu from the package and drain the water.
- Put the tofu between some paper towels.
- Put something heavy on the tofu.

## Frying the tofu

- Cut the tofu into 1 or 1 1/2 inch chunks.
- In a bowl, mix the tofu with some salt and oil.
- Add the tofu to your air fryer.
- Cook at 400F for 15-20 minutes.

## Notes

- You don't need to dry the tofu, but the tofu will crisp up faster if you do.
- I usually put chili powder on the tofu with some salt and black pepper. You taste the powder in the fried part pretty well. I've never tried marinating it over-night.
- Don't mix the tofu too hard with the oil and spices or it will break apart too much.
- 500g seems to make enough for 4 portions.
