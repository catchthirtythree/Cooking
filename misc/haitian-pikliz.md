# Haitian Pikliz

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups thinly sliced cabbage, cut crosswise 2-3 times for shorter shreds (from about 1/4 large cabbage)
- 1 cup julienned or grated carrots (from about 1 medium carrot)
- 1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots (from about 1 large shallot)
- 6 Scotch bonnet peppers, stemmed, quartered
- 3 sprigs thyme
- 8 whole cloves
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 cups (or more) distilled white vinegar
- 3 tablespoons fresh key lime (or regular lime) juice

## Steps

1. Pack cabbage, carrots, shallots, peppers, thyme, cloves, and salt into a 1 1/2-quart resealable jar.
1. Add vinegar and lime juice, seal jar, and shake until ingredients are distributed and salt is dissolved.
1. Add more vinegar if needed to just cover vegetables.
1. Chill, shaking gently twice daily, at least 3 days before serving.

## Notes

- I swapped the scotch bonnets out with dried arbol chilis (4-5).
- I used red onions instead of shallots and it was fine. I would probably choose shallots next time though.
