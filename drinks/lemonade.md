# Lemonade

## Ingredients

- 6 Lemons
- 700ml Water
- 1/2 Cups Sugar
- Lemon juice to taste

## Steps

### Prepare the Lemons

- Using a potato peeler, peel all of the skin from the lemons and save the skin in a bowl. Try not to get too much of the pith if possible, if you do it's no big deal.
- Juice the lemons and save the juice in a container.

### Oleo Saccharum

- Mix all of the sugar with the lemon peels.
- Leave it on the counter for a few hours, covered with plastic wrap or something equivalent.

### Finish

- Boil 700ml of water.
- Pour the water over the lemon peel and sugar mixture and stir to dissolve all of the sugar.
- Strain mixture into a jug.
- Add lemon juice to taste.

## Notes

- I like 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup lemon juice. It's makes for a sweet and slightly tart lemon.
