<!-- @TODO(mheller): A way to list sub-ingredients would be amazing so you could specify how much of a spice blend and what goes in it -->

## Steps

1. Start heating a small pot on medium heat.
1. Add water, milk, honey, spices and salt to the pot.
1. Bring the liquid up to a boil, lower the heat, and let the mixture simmer for at least 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Strain the tea and spices into a cup.
1. Optionally, use an immersion blender to aerate the tea to get a nice foamy head and a nice creamy drink.

## Notes

- Do not boil the tea or spices vigorously for too long otherwise it will taste bitter. Keep the pot to a simmer at most.
- If making your own spice mix, you don't have to grind your spices super fine. They just need to be opened up.
- The ratio that seems to work for me is 2g of tea and spices per 200ml of liquid.
- If you want to turn this into a latte, froth about 50ml of milk and pour over the masala chai.
- The final product is not super sweet, it's just enough to add sweetness to an otherwise spice-forward drink.

## Potential Improvements

- Use less spices to be less wasteful and get a similar result.
- Simmer the tea/spice mixture for less time to get masala chai quicker.
