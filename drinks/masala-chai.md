# Masala Chai

---

### @TODO: I have a completely different way of doing this nowadays. I have to update this.

In short:

1. I steep some spices in 1l of water for some time on the oven, let it chill, then add it to a container.
1. I add black tea to some water in a container (2g tea : 200g water). I don't like the bitter of steeped black tea that much, I just want the flavour.
1. I make a simple syrup with brown sugar and a tiny bit of vanilla extract and add it to a container.
1. I mix some of the spice mixture, some of the cold brewed tea and some of the syrup to about 125ml of milk.
1. I froth the whole thing with a steam wand. If I didn't have one, I would do it on the stove and ladle the mixture a bunch to create bubbles or just whisk it until I like the texture.

I haven't quite figured out the measurements yet to make a chai that I like so I will update this the next time I get to doing it.

## Ingredients

- 200ml Water
- 2g Assam CTC Black Tea
- 2 Cardamom Pods
- 1/2 Cinnamon Stick
- 4 Black Peppercorns
- 200ml 3.5% Milk
- 20g Honey
- Pinch of Salt

## Steps

1. Start heating a small pot on medium heat.
1. Add water, milk, honey, spices and salt to the pot.
1. Bring the liquid up to a boil, lower the heat, and let the mixture simmer for at least 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Strain the tea and spices into a cup.
1. Optionally, use an immersion blender to aerate the tea to get a nice foamy head and a nice creamy drink.

## Notes

- Do not boil the tea or spices vigorously for too long otherwise it will taste bitter. Keep the pot to a simmer at most.
- If making your own spice mix, you don't have to grind your spices super fine. They just need to be opened up.
- The ratio that seems to work for me is 2g of tea and spices per 200ml of liquid.
- If you want to turn this into a latte, froth about 50ml of milk and pour over the masala chai.
- The final product is not super sweet, it's just enough to add sweetness to an otherwise spice-forward drink.

## Potential Improvements

- Use less spices to be less wasteful and get a similar result.
- Simmer the tea/spice mixture for less time to get masala chai quicker.
