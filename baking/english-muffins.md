# English Muffins

## Ingredients

- 1 1/4 cups warm water
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon instant dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons melted butter or oil (canola, vegetable, olive etc.)
- 2 3/4 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Cornmeal, for dusting

## Steps

1. Pour warm water into a large bowl. Sprinkle sugar, then yeast on top. Let sit and foam for 10 minutes.
1. Add in melted butter/oil, flour, and salt and mix with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Once combined, drop dough onto floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, adding just as much flour as needed to make the dough stop sticking to the countertop.
1. Shape the dough into ball and place into an oiled bowl. Cover and let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, sprinkle a few tablespoons of cornmeal on a piece of parchment paper or a towel.
1. Once dough is doubled, knead a few times on a floured surface and then divide into 10 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball by rolling it between the palm of your hand and the countertop.
1. Place the balls onto the prepared parchment and press them into flattish rounds. Sprinkle more cornmeal over the tops of the rolls. Cover rolls with towel and let rise 20 minutes.
1. Heat a large frying pan or skillet and grease with cooking spray. Cooking the muffins in batches, cover and fry on low heat on first side for 9 minutes, until the muffins are puffed up and golden and toasted on the outside. Flip and cook for about 5 more minutes, or until the second side is also golden and toasted.

## Notes

- This recipe says it makes about 10 english muffins which means it makes ~70g muffins which I found to be quite small. I prefer to make 90-105g muffins.
- I prefer to do the last 5 minute cook covered as the insides of the muffins will still be raw if you cook them uncovered for longer. Just be careful that they don't burn on the bottoms.
- I want to find a way to bake these.
