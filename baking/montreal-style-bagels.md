# Montreal Style Bagels

## Ingredients

- 1kg bread flour
- 2g instant yeast
- 40g sugar
- 9g dry malt extract (optional)
- 1 egg
- 465g warm water
- 12ml vegetable oil
- 4L water
- 60ml honey (or malt syrup, or brown sugar, or molasses, etc)
- 100g sesame seeds

## Steps

### Make the Dough

1. Mix together dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately.
1. Mix wet ingredients into dry, and combine into a ragged dough.
1. You can use a stand mixer for this, but it will put a strain on all but the strongest of home units.
1. Knead the dough on an unfloured surface for 12 - 15 minutes until smooth and elastic.
1. This will be a fairly dry dough.
1. Cover dough and lest rest on the bench for 45 - 60 minutes.

### Boil the Bagels

1. Just before shaping the dough place a large pot of water on to just below a boil; dissolve in honey.
1. Divide dough into approx 100g pieces and shape like in the video on an unfloured surface.
1. Drop the shaped bagels onto a floured surface and cover as you shape more.
1. Gently 'boil' the bagels in the honey water for 3 - 5 minutes - don't overcrowd the pot.
1. After boiling, transfer to a sheet tray, and then dip in sesames seeds to coat both sides.

### Bake the Bagels

1. Pre heat oven to 450F.
1. Transfer bagels to your parchment covered baking tray.
1. Bake for 15 minutes or until done.

## Notes

- I tried the Canadian Living bagels and they were fine but not sweet enough.
