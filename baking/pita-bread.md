# Pita Bread

## Ingredients

- 500–530g (17-18.5 oz.) strong white bread flour or 50% white and 50% whole-wheat flour
- 360g (12.7 oz.) lukewarm (40C/ 104F)
- 3 tsp dry instant yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar

## Steps

1. To prepare this pitta bread recipe add in a mixer’s bowl the yeast, sugar and water and blend to dissolve the yeast. Set aside for 5-10 minutes until yeast froths.
1. Add the flour and salt and mix using the dough hook for 6-8 minutes.  Alternatively you could mix the ingredients by hand.
1. Depending on the flour used, the dough may need a little bit less or more flour than this pita bread recipe calls for. After mixing for a while the dough for your pita bread should become an elastic ball and a bit sticky.
1. When ready, coat the dough with olive oil, place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Let it sit in a warm place, for at least 20 minutes or until it doubles its size. This is an important step for this pita bread recipe. The first proof makes the pita bread fluffy and soft. If it is winter, turn the oven on for a minute or two, until it’s a little warm, switch it off and then let the dough rise in it.
1. Take the dough out of the bowl and gently deflate with your hands. Use just a tiny bit of flour to help you if it is too sticky. Split into 6 evenly sized balls around 145g/ 5 oz. each.
1. Let the pita bread balls rest for 15 minutes before shaping. This is the second proof and will allow your dough to relax and become easier to shape.
1. To form the pita bread, you can either use a rolling pin, or stretch it with your hands, about 20cm in diameter. A rolling pin will make a crunchier pita, while hand stretching a softer, fluffier one. If the dough springs back, set it aside for a few minutes to rest and then continue rolling again.
1. For a more traditional look on your pita bread, press the dough firmly with your fingertips forming dimples or use a fork to make some holes on top.
1. For a faster baked pita, heat a non-sticking frying pan to medium heat and add just a little bit of olive oil and wipe off any excess. Bake each pita bread for about 3 minutes on each side, until slightly coloured and still soft. If your pan has a lid, place the lid on while baking them to keep the moisture in.
1. For a fluffier pita use the steam method. Cut a piece of aluminium foil to the size of your pan. Generously sprinkle and spread some olive oil on it. Shape and place your pita on the foil. Pour a large glug of water in your plan over medium low heat – it should start steaming immediately! Place your pita immediately in it and cover with the lid. Let it steam for 12-15 minutes. Take it out, flip it over and cook for another 2-3 minutes on the foil.
1. To give it more colour, when you flip your pita bread, push it lightly with a wooden spoon on the pan.

## Notes

- I definitely did not follow the steps exactly, I just made it like I would make bread and it worked out very nicely.
- If you don't need all of it at once, you can take some off of your dough ball that's resting in your fridge and it will keep fermenting and proofing itself in your fridge. I used my pita bread over 3-4 days just ripping what I needed off of what was resting in the fridge.
- Rolling these is the most annoying bit. You will need a decent amount of flour and a lot of rolling until they stop springing back on you as much.
- I used my dough right out of the fridge and they were fine. No proofing needed.
- You can kind of slice these open and stuff them without them ripping. Just make sure you don't put anything too saucy inside or they will rip at the bottom.
- I made a pita sandwhich with julienned carrots and cucumbers, pickled onions and tzatziki and it was amazing.
