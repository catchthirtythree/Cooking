# Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup softened butter
- 1 1/4 cups sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 cups blueberries, washed, drained and picked over
- 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup quick oats

## Steps

- Preheat the oven to 375.
- Cream the butter and sugar until light.
- Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. Add milk.
- Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder, and add to the creamed mixture.
- Crush 1/2 cup blueberries with a fork, and mix into the batter. Fold in the remaining whole berries.
- Line a 12 cup standard muffin tin with cupcake liners, and fill with batter. Bake at 375 degrees for about 30-35 minutes.
- Remove muffins from tin and cool at least 30 minutes. Store, uncovered, or the muffins will be too moist the second day, if they last that long.

## Notes

- We used 3/4 - 1 cup sugar and they came out tasting more like oats and blueberries with a bit of sweetness; a little healthier tasting.
- 1 1/4 cups flour to 3/4 cups quick oats seemed to be the sweet spot.
