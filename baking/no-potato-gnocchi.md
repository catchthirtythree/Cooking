# Potato-less Gnocchi

## Ingredients

- 250 grams of flour
- 40 gr of butter
- 1 pinch of salt
- 30 cl of milk
- 3 eggs
- salt
- 3 tbsp parmesan cheese

## Steps

### Create mash potato mixture

- Add milk and butter to a pot and heat to a boil.
- Once boiling, remove from the heat, add half the flour and mix really well.
- Move to pot back onto the heat and keep mixing until the "dough" unsticks from the pan.
- Remove from the heat once more.
- Using a whisk, add one egg at a time and whip the mixture until all eggs are incorporated.
- Add the parmesan cheese and whip until incorporated.

### Make dough

- Spread the other half of the flour to a work surface and lay your dough over top.
- Knead your dough until all of the flour is incorporated and the dough is still a bit sticky.

### Make gnocchi shape

- Split the dough into balls and roll them out into ropes.
- Cut into 3/4 inch pillows.
- Toss the pillows with a little flour so the sides aren't sticky.

### Cooking the gnocchi

- Bring a heavily salted pot of water to a boil.
- Add your gnocchi to the water.
- Once the gnocchi are floating on the surface (anywhere between 2 - 5 minutes), drain the water.
- Heat a pan to medium-hot, then add oil.
- Add gnocchi to the pan and brown on both sides.
- Toss with the sauce of your choice and top with the cheese of your choice and some herbs.

## Notes

- In the first step, you are looking for the consistency of mashed potatoes.
- In the second step, the dough will seem like it will continue taking in flour no matter how much you add. It will continue to feel light and not like a bread / pasta dough ball. This is good, it will keep the gnocchi pillowy when cooked. There will be a point where if you roll the dough off the flour, it will eventually get a little sticky but not too much. That is your tell that the flour needs no more flour.
- There might be easier recipes (just flour and water) but this is just the one I tried and it came out pretty well. A little flour-y but that's my fault as I tried to double the recipe and added a lot of flour when kneading the dough. I would try less flour in the final stages next time. I think I did 300ml milk, 300ml water, 3 eggs, and maybe 600-700g flour.
- If you've made a big batch of gnocchi and want to store it, put all of the gnocchi on a tray (preferably lined with flour but I've had them stick and they were easy to knock off the tray once frozen) and put the tray in the freezer. Once the gnocchi are frozen, add them to a freezer bag and store in the freezer. Every resource I've seen says they last up to 6 weeks in the freezer.
