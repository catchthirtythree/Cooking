# Bread

## Ingredients

- 100 parts Unbleached High-Protein Flour
- 85 parts Warm Water
- 0.5 parts Active Dry Yeast
- 2.3 parts Kosher Salt
- A Damp Towel
- A Dutch Oven
- Parchment Paper

## Steps

- Mix 2 parts water and all of your yeast together in a small dish and leave for 20 minutes.
- Mix water and flour in a large bowl with a spatula until there is no more loose flour in the bowl.
- Sprinkle the salt over the top of the dough.
- Let the dough sit covered until the yeast mixture is done.
- Pour the yeast mixture into the dough and use a wet hand to combine everything together.
- Cover and let sit for 30 minutes.
- With a wet hand, stretch the dough from the outside towards the center.
- Let the dough sit for another 30 minutes and stretch it again.
- Place the bowl in the fridge to bulk ferment for at least 5 hours.
- Gently release the dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface.
- Shape your dough and let it sit with a damp towel over it for about an hour. If you let the bread rest for too long, it will lose its height.
- Pre-heat your oven to 450F with a lidded dutch oven in it.
- When the oven comes to temperature, place your dough on a piece of parchment paper.
- Put the dough in the dutch oven and close the lid.
- Put the dutch oven in the oven for 30 minutes.
- Remove the lid from the dutch oven and leave it for another 20 minutes.
- Remove the bread from the dutch oven and place it on a cooling rack.
- Let the bread rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting into it.

## Notes

- High-Protein Flour is made-up of 13%+ protein. Five Roses All-Purpose Flour is 13.3% protein. King Arthur All-Purpose Flour is closer to 11%.
- Warm Water is between 90F and 100F. Warm Water will help your yeast activate faster. If the temperature is above 105F, your yeast may die.
- Make sure your yeast is still alive. I always put my yeast in 15-30g of water for 15-20 minutes while my dough autolyses.
