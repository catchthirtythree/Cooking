# Bread

## Ingredients

- 100 parts Unbleached High-Protein Flour
- 85 parts Warm Water
- 0.5 parts Active Dry Yeast
- 2.3 parts Kosher Salt
- A Damp Towel
- A Dutch Oven
- Parchment Paper

## Steps

1. Mix 2 parts water and all of your yeast together in a small dish and leave for 20 minutes.
1. Mix water and flour in a large bowl with a spatula until there is no more loose flour in the bowl.
1. Sprinkle the salt over the top of the dough.
1. Let the dough sit covered until the yeast mixture is done.
1. Pour the yeast mixture into the dough and use a wet hand to combine everything together.
1. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes.
1. With a wet hand, stretch the dough from the outside towards the center.
1. Let the dough sit for another 30 minutes and stretch it again.
1. Place the bowl in the fridge to bulk ferment for at least 5 hours.
1. Gently release the dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface.
1. Shape your dough and let it sit with a damp towel over it for about an hour. If you let the bread rest for too long, it will lose its height.
1. Pre-heat your oven to 450F with a lidded dutch oven in it.
1. When the oven comes to temperature, place your dough on a piece of parchment paper.
1. Put the dough in the dutch oven and close the lid.
1. Put the dutch oven in the oven for 30 minutes.
1. Remove the lid from the dutch oven and leave it for another 20 minutes.
1. Remove the bread from the dutch oven and place it on a cooling rack.
1. Let the bread rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting into it.

## Notes

- High-Protein Flour is made-up of 13%+ protein. Five Roses All-Purpose Flour is 13.3% protein. King Arthur All-Purpose Flour is closer to 11%.
- Warm Water is between 90F and 100F. Warm Water will help your yeast activate faster. If the temperature is above 105F, your yeast may die.
- Make sure your yeast is still alive. I always put my yeast in 15-30g of water for 15-20 minutes while my dough autolyses.
